![welcome](https://www.gemeentenieuwstad.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/welcome.png)
Report hackers and hackwebsites please.

The latest MySQL plugin is breaking this resource! Only use: https://github.com/dutchplayers/fivem-mysql-async

We have edited the original esx_inventoryhud resource from Trsak.

This inventory only works with the latest version of ESX.

Your help is much appreciated in a pull request!

We did not make any of these scripts. We do not take any credits. Did we forget to mention you in the credits? Then let us know in our Discord server or create an issue!
